# Chapter 5.5: Three-Dimensional Velocity Inversion

## Purpose

In previous lecture, we used a known velocity structure to predict how seismic waves travel.  We generally do not know the velocity structure in advance and it is something we want to determine.

In this chapter, we develop a framework for:

- Defining and interpreting travel-time residuals
- Linearizing the inverse problem for small velocity perturbations
- Formulating the problem as a system of equations
- Understanding the role of damping, smoothing, and resolution in tomographic inversion

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
- Distinguish between the forward and inverse problems
- Formulate inverse problems as d=Gm and solve using least squares
- Explain non-uniqueness and the role of regularization

## The Geophysical Forward Problem versus the Geophysical Inverse Problem

Often in geophysics, we have to solve the **inverse problem**. The inverse problem is the estimations of parameters of a **model** of the Earth system from **data** or observations. The inverse problem is different from the forward problem.


👉 **The Forward Problem** aka the direct problem or the forward model

Given a model **m**, the forward problem computes the data **d** that would be observed.

$$ 
\mathbf{d} = F(\mathbf{m})
$$

where F maps from the model to data space as shown below:

```

The forward problem has a solution that:

1. exists.
2. is unique.
3. is stable (i.e. a small model change $\delta m$ gives a small data change $\delta d$).

An example of the forward problem is calculting arrival times for seismic waves given a seismic velocity model. Forward problems are phyiscal problems that occur in nature. Inverse problems are mathematical.

👉 **The Inverse Problem** 

Given an observed set of data **d**, determine what model parameters **m** gave rise to that data.

$$ 
\mathbf{m} = F^{-1}(\mathbf{d})
$$

where $F^{-1}$ maps from the model to data space as shown below:

```{figure} ../figures/05_inverse_problem.png

name: Inverse Problem

```

The inverse problem has a solution that:

1. may or may not exist.
2. is generally non-unique (i.e. an infinite number of acceptable models can be found to fit the data).
3. is often unstable (i.e. a small change to the data $\delta d$, such as **noise**, gives a large model change $\delta m$).

An example of the inverse problem is solving for the Earth velocity structure, given an observed set of seismic arrival times.

## Three-dimensional (And Two-Dimensional) Velocity Inversion

Observed seismic travel times (**data**) are often different from predicted seismic travel times (**model**). We can compare the two using the **travel time *residual***.

$$ 
t_{resid} = t_{obs} - t_{pred}
$$

- If $t_{resid} < 0$, the velocity model we are using is too slow.
- If $t_{resid} > 0$, the velocity model we are using is too fast.

Residuals are often plotted on histograms showing that there is natural scatter in our tavel time data. 

- If the average residual is zero, the data is well modeled using a 1D velocity model.
- If the average residual is nonzero, as in the example below, we must reevaluate the velocity model and a 2D or 3D velocity model may become necessary to resolve lateral velocity perturbations. This process is called ***seismic tomography***.

## Setting up the Tomography Problem

In the tomographic problem we parameterize the velocity model as a number of blocks of uniform velocity perturbations. Rays travel through the velocity model from a source point to and end point.

name: Ray Path and 2D Tomography Problem.

```

When you know the geometry of the seismic ray, the reference travel time through each block in the velocity model can be given by:

$$
\Delta t_0 = \Delta x u_0
$$

where $\Delta x$ is the ray path distance through the block and $u_0$ is the local reference slowness (model).

Our observed travel time for this block is slightly different than the predicted travel time. We assume a slight perturbation to our velocity model such that the observed slowness of the block, $u$, is given by 

$$
u = u_0 (1+s)
$$ 

or the modeled slowness ($u_0$) plus some small fractional slowness perturbation, $s$. The contribution of this slowness perturbation to the travel time residual is therefore:

$$
\Delta r = \Delta t - \Delta t_0 = \Delta x u_0 (1+s) - \Delta x u_0 = \Delta t_0 s
$$

If we sum all slowness perturbations along the entire ray path, the total travel time residual is:

$$
r = \sum_k b_k s_k 
$$

where $b_k$ is the ray travel time in the *k*th block and $s_k$ is the fractional slowness perturbation in *k*th block.

If we now consider the solution for many rays where the ray number is $i$, we get:

$$
r_i = \sum_{j=1}^m b_{ij} s_{j}
$$

where $m$ is the total number of model blocks. If a ray does not enter a block, we set that equal to 0. In this case, $s_k$ values are fractional related to the starting model i.e. an $s_k$ value of -0.01 means the solution is 1% slower than the starting model. 

If we have $n$ number of residuals, this becomes a matrix problem:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
r_1 \\
r_2 \\
... \\
r_n
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} & ... \\
b_{21} & b_{22} & ... \\
... & ... & b_{nm} 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
s_1 \\
s_2 \\
... \\
s_m
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This can be written in the form:

$$
\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{G} \mathbf{m}
$$

where $\mathbf{d}$ is our data vector (i.e. our travel time residuals), $\mathbf{m}$ is our model vector (i.e. our slowness perturbations), and $\mathbf{G}$ is a linear operator (holding the travel times of each ray in each block) that predicts the model from the data.

## Ex. Toy Tomography Model

Let's practice by setting up a toy tomography model.

Here is the (a) the model and ray geomogety for a 2D toy problem, (b) the test input velocity model to create synthetic data, and (c) the least squares solution.
```

Let's start by defining $\mathbf{d}$, $\mathbf{G}$, and the true slowness perturbation model, $\mathbf{m}_{true}$.

## Least-Squares Inversion

Most rays will travel through a limited number of blocks. Typically, $\mathbf{G}$ will hold mostly zeros. If the number of travel time observations is greater than the number of model blocks ($n>m$) and our problem is over-determined, then we can solve using the *least squares solution*:

$$
\mathbf{m} = (\mathbf{G}^T\mathbf{G})^{-1} \mathbf{G}^T \mathbf{d}
$$

For most tomographic problems, $\mathbf{G}^T\mathbf{G}$ is invariably singular or ill-conditioned. This can be due to:
- Near identical ray paths,
- Blocks being oversampled or not sampled at all,
- Or having a model so large that we cannnot solve using direct matrix inversion.

---

## Regularization: Damping

A common approach to ill-conditioned least squares inversion is to use regularization using *damped least squares inversion*.  We therefore solve:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{d} \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{G} \\
\lambda \mathbf{I}
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{m}
$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix and $\lambda$ is a weighting parameter that controls damping. The solution to this equation minimizes the function:

$$
|| \mathbf{G}\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{d} ||^2 + \lambda^2 ||\mathbf{m}||^2
$$

where the first term is the misfit to the data and the second term is the variance of the model. $\lambda$ controls the trade-off between misfit and model variance. 


Increasing damping will add stability to the solution. However, a damped least squares solution will not increase model smoothness. Model perturbations in adjacent blocks can still be quite significant.

---

## Regularization: Smoothing

Commonly, to measure model roughness we compute a *Laplacian operator* $\nabla^2$. This is a difference operator over 2D or 3D block geometries. To minimize roughness, we solve for:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{d} \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{G} \\
\lambda \mathbf{L}
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{m}
$$

where $\mathbf{L}$ is a finite difference approximation of the Lapacian over all model blocks. For example in 2D, the Laplacian of the *j*th block becomes:

$$
\nabla_j^2 \simeq 0.25 (m_{left} + m_{right} + m_{up} + m_{down}) - m_j
$$

where $m_{left}, m_{right}, m_{up}, m_{down}$ are the cells directly adjacent to cell $m_j$. This Lapacian minimizes:

$$
|| \mathbf{G}\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{d} ||^2 + \lambda^2 ||L\mathbf{m}||^2
$$

Where $\lambda$ therefore controls the trade-off between misfit and model roughness. A model can therefore be selected that is smooth but does not minimize variance. Blocks are not sampled directly by ray paths but rather interpolated from nearby cells. Typically, $\lambda$ is selected to miminimize the L-curve:

```{figure} ../figures/05_L_curve.png
---
name: L Curve.
width: 400px
---
The L-Curve is the statistical model used to select the $\lambda$ value such that you minimize both misfit and model variance.
```

If we select a very smooth model, we don't care about fitting the data. Inversely, mimimizing data misfit might cause huge increases to model roughness. It is typically pointless to try to fit data perfectly, because all data has inherent error or noise.
___

The ideal type of regularization, whether damping or smoothing, will depend on the exact inversion problem. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.

For example, one should distrust a damped least-squares solution when there is significant fine velocity structure at the scale-length of the block dimensions.  Minimum roughness models are suspect when there are large-amplitude anomalies in regions with little data.

## Limitations of the Tomography Problem

1. Approximating the travel time residual as a sum of the slowness perturbations, $s$, in each block is only valid if the slowness perturbations are small i.e $s<<1$.
2. Conventional linear algebra methods break down for large models where $m$ is very large. This is particularly true for 3D problems. Sparse matrix calculations are therefore necessary for large problems.
3. Seimsic tomography works best for a large number of ray geometries in each cells with varied ray paths. This is not often the case. Tomography models are highly biased by ray coverage. Typically rays in a problem will appear at only some geometries, covering only a small percentage of the model blocks. This leads to biases in the solution along these ray paths:

```{figure} ../figures/05_ray_geometry.png
---
name: Ray Angle Biases.
width: 400px

Ray angles in tomographic problems are typically limited. Therefore, resolution in of velocity anomalies is limited parallel to the ray path.
